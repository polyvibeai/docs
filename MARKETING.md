# Marketing — Polyvibe

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Organic / UGC-First (Current)
The initial marketing strategy is entirely content and community-driven. We are not running paid ads until we have validated that the product creates organic sharing behavior.

**Rationale:** If Polyvibe is truly magical, people will share it. UGC is the proof of that magic. We use UGC creators to seed content, simulate organic virality, and test messaging before spending on paid acquisition.

### Core Channels
1. **TikTok** — Primary channel for Gen Z acquisition; viral potential for try-on content
2. **Instagram Reels** — Secondary channel; reach and influencer ecosystem
3. **App Store Optimization (ASO)** — Discoverability within App Store search

## UGC Campaign Strategy

### Content Type
- Creator records a video trying on an outfit virtually with Polyvibe
- Shows the before/after: "I wanted to try this on before I bought it…" → AI try-on reveal
- Authentic, raw, relatable — not produced
- Ends with clear CTA: download link, landing page

### UGC Creator Profile (Target)
- Gen Z women, 18–26
- Style-interested, not necessarily fashion influencers
- Authentic voice, comfortable on camera
- Audience on TikTok and/or Instagram (nano to mid-tier preferred for authenticity)

### Content Hooks (Tested / To Test)
- "I tried on 10 outfits without leaving my couch"
- "This AI showed me what I'd look like in [trend] and I'm obsessed"
- "POV: You can try on anything before buying"
- "Found my vibe using AI"
- "I was about to return this… until I saw myself in it"

### UGC Production Process
1. Brief creators with app access + talking points
2. Creators produce raw content (multiple takes / angles)
3. Review for authenticity and brand safety
4. Distribute natively on creator accounts + with permission on brand channels
5. Track: views, saves, shares, link clicks, downloads

- Scale with paid amplification of best-performing organic content
- Expand to macro influencers with proven style audiences
