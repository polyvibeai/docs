# Business — Polyvibe

## Business Model

Polyvibe operates on a dual-revenue model: **affiliate commerce** as the primary revenue stream, and **PRO subscriptions** as the secondary stream. This combination allows the product to be free for most users while monetizing naturally through commerce intent.

---

## Revenue Streams

### 1. Affiliate Commerce (Primary)
- Every product featured in the app carries an affiliate link
- When a user shops a look — whether from their own generation or from the community feed — Polyvibe earns a commission
- Commission rates vary by brand and affiliate network (typically 5–15% per sale in fashion)
- This revenue scales directly with the quality of the try-on experience: better try-ons → more purchase confidence → more conversions
- No inventory, no fulfillment — pure margin business

**Key insight:** The try-on experience is the conversion tool. A user who has "worn" an outfit virtually is dramatically more likely to purchase than one who has only seen a flat product image. This is Polyvibe's core commercial thesis.

### 2. PRO Subscriptions (Secondary)
- Free tier includes limited generations per month (cap TBD)
- PRO tier unlocks:
  - Unlimited generations
  - Faster processing / priority queue
  - Advanced features (multi-item outfits, enhanced customization)
  - Early access to new categories
- Pricing TBD — expected range: $9.99–$19.99/month
- PRO launches in Phase 3 after proving engagement and retention with free users

### 3. Future Revenue Opportunities (Not Yet Prioritized)
- Brand partnerships / sponsored content in feed
- White-label try-on technology for fashion retailers
- Creator monetization tools (affiliate revenue sharing with top users)
- Data and trend insights (anonymized, privacy-compliant)

## Legal Structure

### Entity
- **Type:** Delaware LLC
- **Formed:** December 2024
- **Members:** Phil Karl (50%) + William Key (50%)
- **Operating Agreement:** In place

### Planned C-Corp Conversion
- The LLC will be converted to a Delaware C-Corporation prior to raising venture capital
- **Reason:** Venture capital firms (especially institutional) require C-Corp structure
- **Tax Strategy:** C-Corp conversion is timed to maximize **Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS)** benefits under IRC Section 1202
  - QSBS allows founders and early investors to exclude up to $10M (or 10x basis) in capital gains from federal taxes on qualifying stock
  - The 5-year holding period begins at conversion / issuance, so earlier conversion = earlier QSBS eligibility
  - Must remain under $50M in gross assets at time of stock issuance to qualify
- **Advisors:** Professional legal and accounting advisors engaged for entity optimization

### Trademark
- **Filed:** USPTO trademark application submitted
- **Classes:** Multiple classes covering the Polyvibe name and brand
- **Status:** Pending (USPTO review timeline: 8–12 months typically)
- Trademark strategy protects the brand as we scale and as imitators emerge

### Legal Documents
- Operating Agreement (LLC)

## Fundraising Strategy

### Current Status
- Bootstrapped / self-funded
- Focused on achieving product-market fit before raising

### Target Raise
- Seed round anticipated after MVP validation and early user traction
- Target investors: AI-focused VCs, consumer app funds, fashion/commerce-adjacent investors
- QSBS-optimized structure will be in place before any institutional round

### Strategic Acquisition Consideration
- The AI market is extremely active with strategic acquisitions
- Polyvibe's combination of proprietary user data, avatar technology, and commerce relationships creates acquisition appeal for:
  - Large fashion retailers (LVMH, Nordstrom, etc.)
  - Social platforms (Pinterest, TikTok, Instagram)
  - AI companies expanding into consumer verticals
  - E-commerce platforms (Shopify, Amazon)
- Building with acquisition optionality in mind without optimizing exclusively for it

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) | < $10 (organic/UGC-driven initially) |
| LTV (Lifetime Value) | To be validated post-launch |

| Affiliate Conversion Rate | 2–5% of try-on sessions |
| Monthly Churn (PRO) | < 5% target |

## Key Business Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| AI generation quality | Continuous model improvement; quality gates before launch |
| Affiliate commission rate compression | Diversify brand partnerships; build direct brand relationships |
| Platform dependency (App Store) | Build web-based version in parallel (Framer landing page → web app) |
| Copycat competitors | Speed to market, brand building, user data moat, trademark protection |
| Avatar privacy concerns | Clear privacy policy, no data selling, transparent data use |
| Slow user growth | UGC-first marketing, influencer seeding, product virality loops |
