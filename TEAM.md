## Culture and Working Principles

- **Documentation-first:** All decisions, strategies, and specifications are documented in writing. This repo is the source of truth.
- **Async-friendly:** Team and collaborators are geographically distributed — documentation and written communication are essential
- **Speed with quality:** We move fast but maintain quality gates, especially on AI generation output
- **Research over assumptions:** We validate with users before building, not after
- **Iterative design:** Everything from logos to messaging is refined through feedback loops, not committee decisions
