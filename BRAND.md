# Brand — Polyvibe

## Brand Identity

### Name
**Polyvibe** (formerly Instastyle — rebranded for broader positioning and trademark distinctiveness)

The name "Polyvibe" signals:
- **Poly** — many, multiple, diverse (many vibes, many styles, many people)
- **Vibe** — aesthetic, feeling, mood, energy — the language of Gen Z style culture
- Together: a platform for exploring and expressing every dimension of personal style

### Tagline / Hero Headline
**"What's your vibe?"**

This is the primary brand question and the emotional hook of the product. It is:
- Conversational and Gen Z-native
- Open-ended (invites exploration rather than directing behavior)
- Non-prescriptive (doesn't tell users what vibe to have)
- Ownable as a brand statement

### Cycling Sub-Headlines (Landing Page / Onboarding)
The hero section of the landing page and onboarding screens use rotating sub-headlines to speak to different user motivations:
- "Try it on before you buy it."
- "Find your style. Wear it before you own it."
- "Style yourself with AI."
- "Discover looks made for you."
- "Your wardrobe, reimagined."
(Copy continues to be refined — add new variants to this list as developed)

## Positioning

### Core Positioning Statement
Polyvibe is the AI-powered style platform where you can virtually try on any outfit, discover your personal aesthetic, and shop looks you've already seen yourself wearing.

### Category We're Creating
"Pinterest for generative AI" — a discovery and inspiration platform powered by personalized AI visualization, not static images.

### What We Are
- A personal style exploration tool
- A social discovery platform for fashion
- A confidence builder before purchase
- A bridge between AI creativity and real-world commerce

### What We Are Not
- A shopping cart or e-commerce store
- A photo filter app
- A generic AI image generator
- A social media app (we use social mechanics, but that's not the primary value)

## Brand Voice

### Tone
- **Confident but not arrogant** — we believe in the product deeply without being preachy
- **Playful but not frivolous** — fun and energetic, but with substance
- **Inclusive** — every body, every style, every vibe is welcome
- **Aspirational without being elitist** — style is for everyone, not just fashion insiders
- **Direct** — Gen Z doesn't want corporate speak; we communicate clearly and authentically

### Voice Examples

| Avoid | Prefer |
|---|---|
| "Leverage our AI technology to optimize your wardrobe selection" | "See yourself in it before you buy it." |
| "Our platform enables fashion discovery through advanced machine learning" | "Try on anything. Find your vibe." |
| "Experience seamless virtual try-on capabilities" | "What would you look like in that?" |
| "Join our growing community of fashion enthusiasts" | "Your style. Your rules." |

## Visual Identity

### Logo Direction
- Exploring concepts combining a **palm tree** motif with **AI sparkle / generative elements**
- The palm tree evokes: vacation energy, aspiration, warmth, California/Miami vibes, Gen Z aesthetic
- The AI sparkle/star element communicates: magic, technology, transformation, generativity
- Logo should work in: app icon format (small), horizontal lockup, wordmark-only
- Final logo: TBD — iteration ongoing with AI Figma designer

### Color Direction
- Warm, vibrant palette that feels fashion-forward and tech-forward simultaneously
- Not the cold blues of enterprise tech — this is a consumer lifestyle brand
- Specific hex values: TBD pending logo finalization

### Typography
- Modern, clean, slightly editorial
- Feels at home in both a fashion magazine and a tech product
- Specific fonts: TBD pending brand guidelines completion

### Photography / Imagery Style
- Real people in real settings, elevated
- AI-generated looks should feel aspirational but achievable
- Diverse representation across body types, skin tones, ages, and aesthetics
- Clean, well-lit, editorial quality — not stock photo aesthetic

## Brand Expansion Philosophy

Polyvibe's brand is designed to grow beyond fashion. The "vibe" construct is intentionally broad:
- Style vibe → Fashion (MVP)
- Home vibe → Interior design
- Beauty vibe → Makeup and hair
- Fit vibe → Activewear and fitness aesthetics
- Travel vibe → Destination and lifestyle

The brand promise — "explore any creative vision of yourself or your world before committing to it" — stretches naturally across all these categories.
