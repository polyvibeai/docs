# Competitors — Polyvibe

## Overview

Polyvibe operates at the intersection of AI virtual try-on, social discovery, and affiliate commerce. No single competitor combines all three — but several well-funded players are attacking parts of this space. This document maps the competitive landscape across five categories: direct consumer competitors, B2B try-on technology providers, retailer-built try-on features, affiliate/creator commerce platforms, and social discovery platforms.

For Polyvibe's positioning relative to each category, see the [Polyvibe Differentiators](#polyvibe-differentiators) section at the bottom.

## Direct Consumer Competitors

These are the closest competitors — consumer-facing apps that combine AI try-on with some form of social or commerce experience.

### Doji

- **What they do:** AI avatar-based virtual try-on app. Users upload selfies and full-body photos to create a personalized avatar, then try on real clothes from brands.
- **Funding:** $14M seed (May 2025), led by Thrive Capital with Seven Seven Six Ventures
- **Founders:** Dorian Dargan (ex-Apple VisionOS, ex-Meta Oculus) and Jim Winkens (ex-DeepMind, ex-Google)
- **HQ:** New York City
- **Stage:** Invite-only, live in 80+ countries
- **Strengths:**
  - Strong AI/ML pedigree from founders (DeepMind, Apple, Meta)
  - Well-capitalized with top-tier VC backing
  - Avatar-first approach similar to Polyvibe's core thesis
  - Plans to integrate buying functionality to keep users in-app
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Avatar creation takes ~30 minutes (slow onboarding)
  - No social feed or community discovery layer yet
  - No affiliate commerce integration yet — still building toward checkout
  - Invite-only limits growth velocity
- **Threat level:** High — closest to Polyvibe's vision. Watch closely.

### Gensmo

- **What they do:** AI fashion agent with virtual try-on, style matching, and shoppable recommendations. Features include avatar-based try-on and "Vibe Imagine" (visualize looks based on mood/aesthetic).
- **Funding:** $60M+ seed (June 2025)
- **Founders:** Ning Hu (ex-Google, ex-Alibaba VP, PhD in AI from Carnegie Mellon)
- **HQ:** New York / Los Angeles / Bay Area / Seattle

  - "Vibe" language mirrors Polyvibe's positioning (market validation)
  - Deep AI expertise from founding team
  - Already generating viral TikTok content
  - Connected to e-commerce platforms and independent boutiques
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Agent-first (chat-based) rather than visual-first — different UX paradigm
  - No social community or feed-based discovery
  - Heavy on recommendations, lighter on the "see yourself in it" magic moment
  - Massive team and multi-city operation creates coordination overhead
- **Threat level:** High — most well-funded direct competitor. The "Vibe" overlap in positioning is notable.

### Alta (Alta Daily)

- **What they do:** AI stylist and personal shopper that creates outfit recommendations based on user's closet, lifestyle, budget, occasion, and weather. Includes avatar-based try-on mixing shoppable items with owned wardrobe items.
- **Funding:** $11M seed (June 2025), led by Menlo Ventures. Investors include Aglaé Ventures (LVMH/Arnault family), Anthropic's Anthology fund, DoorDash CEO Tony Xu, Karlie Kloss
- **Founder:** Jenny Wang (Harvard engineering, investor/technical advisor background)
- **HQ:** San Francisco
- **Traction:** 270K+ outfits generated daily, 4,000+ brand partners, CFDA partnership
- **Strengths:**
  - LVMH-adjacent investors signal fashion credibility
  - Closet integration (mixing owned items with shoppable items) is compelling
  - Weather-aware and occasion-aware recommendations add practical value
  - Strong early traction and brand partnerships
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Styling/recommendation focus rather than social discovery
  - No community feed or public sharing mechanics
  - More utilitarian ("what should I wear?") than aspirational ("what's my vibe?")
  - Doesn't target the social creator persona
- **Threat level:** Medium — different angle (AI stylist vs. AI try-on + social), but overlapping user base.

### Daydream

- **What they do:** AI-powered chat-based fashion shopping agent. Conversational interface for discovering and buying fashion. Commission-based marketplace model with 200+ retail partners and ~2M products.
- **Funding:** $50M seed (June 2024), from Forerunner Ventures, Index Ventures, Google Ventures, True Ventures. Karlie Kloss also an investor.
- **Founder:** Julie Bornstein (ex-Nordstrom, ex-Sephora, ex-Stitch Fix COO). Previously founded THE YES, which was acquired by Pinterest in 2022. Chief Strategy Officer is Richard Kim, ex-Head of Shopping Strategy at Pinterest.
- **HQ:** Not specified
- **Traction:** iPhone app launched June 2025, 8,000+ brands, ~2M products
- **Strengths:**
  - Founder has deep retail/fashion executive experience and a Pinterest acquisition exit
  - Massive seed round signals strong investor conviction
  - Commission-based model (similar to Polyvibe's affiliate thesis) already live
  - Chat-based UX feels modern and is well-suited to AI-native users
  - Pinterest DNA in the leadership team
- **Weaknesses:**
  - No virtual try-on — purely text/image search and recommendations
  - No social layer or community discovery
  - No avatar creation or "see yourself in it" moment
  - Chat-first UX may not appeal to visual-first fashion shoppers
- **Threat level:** Medium — strong on commerce and discovery, but missing the AI try-on magic that is Polyvibe's core hook.

### Oji (by Prequel)

- **What they do:** AI avatar and photo generator app. Users create stylized AI versions of themselves across many visual themes (anime, retro, vintage, etc.). Sister app to PREQUEL photo editor (57M+ downloads).
- **Funding:** Not publicly disclosed
- **Traction:** 1.7M+ downloads, 4.3/5 rating
- **Strengths:**
  - Proven avatar generation technology
  - Large existing user base from PREQUEL ecosystem
  - Fun, shareable output that drives organic virality
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Entertainment/novelty focus — not connected to fashion commerce
  - No try-on functionality with real garments
  - No social feed or discovery mechanics
  - Subscription model ($7/week or $30/year) may limit reach
- **Threat level:** Low — adjacent in avatar tech, but not in fashion or commerce.

## AI Try-On Technology Providers (B2B / API)

These companies sell virtual try-on as infrastructure. They are potential partners, potential technology benchmarks, and potential competitors if they move into consumer apps.

### FASHN AI

- **What they do:** API-first virtual try-on platform for developers and fashion brands. Offers try-on, AI model generation, product-to-model photography, background removal, and more.
- **Key specs:** 1.2B-parameter flow-matching model, 5–17 second generation time, $0.04–$0.075 per image
- **Strengths:** Developer-friendly, fast iteration, open-sourced parts of their stack, ComfyUI integration
- **Weaknesses:** B2B-only — no consumer app, no social layer, no brand/discovery
- **Relevance to Polyvibe:** Potential API provider or technical benchmark. Their open-source releases (FASHN VTON v1.5) could inform Polyvibe's generation pipeline.

### Auglio

- **What they do:** AR-based virtual try-on for eyewear, cosmetics, and jewelry. Shopify and WooCommerce integrations. Real-time camera-based try-on with 3D modeling.
- **Pricing:** From $119/month for merchants
- **Strengths:** Proven conversion lift (300–400% reported), strong Shopify ecosystem presence, pupillary distance measurement for eyewear
- **Weaknesses:** Limited to accessories (eyewear, jewelry, cosmetics) — no fashion apparel, no consumer app, no social features
- **Relevance to Polyvibe:** Different product category. Could inform future expansion into accessories.

### Kling AI (Kuaishou)

- **What they do:** Consumer AI platform with virtual try-on as one feature among many (video generation, image generation, avatars). Try-on supports 180+ styles with fabric simulation.
- **Parent:** Kuaishou (Chinese tech company)
- **Key specs:** ~7 second render time, supports single and multi-garment try-on, virtual model creation via text prompt
- **Strengths:** Advanced fabric simulation, video-based try-on output, free tier available, cross-platform (phone/desktop/tablet)
- **Weaknesses:** Try-on is a feature, not the core product — buried among many AI tools. No social discovery or commerce layer. Watermarked free output. Chinese parent company may raise trust concerns for US users.
- **Relevance to Polyvibe:** Technical benchmark for try-on quality. Polyvibe's focused product experience vs. Kling's everything-AI platform is a key differentiator.

---

## Retailer-Built Try-On

Major retailers building try-on into their existing shopping experiences. These validate the market but are locked to their own inventory.

### Google Virtual Try-On / Doppl

- **What they do:** Virtual try-on integrated into Google Search, Shopping, and Images. Covers billions of items from retailers like Macy's, Kohl's, Walmart, Nordstrom. Launched experimental Doppl app for deeper try-on experiences including AI video.
- **Technology:** Custom diffusion-based model. December 2025 update allows try-on from just a selfie (previously required full-body photo).
- **Strengths:** Massive scale (billions of items), integrated into the world's largest search engine, AI video try-on via Doppl, no avatar creation needed
- **Weaknesses:** Try-on is a shopping feature, not a social or creative experience. No community, no sharing, no style discovery beyond product search. Doppl is experimental and could be killed (Google's track record with consumer apps).
- **Threat level:** Low-medium — validates the market at scale but occupies a completely different product category (search utility vs. social style platform).

### Walmart (via Zeekit)

- **What they do:** Virtual try-on in mobile app via Zeekit acquisition (2021). "Choose My Model" (50+ body types), "Be Your Own Model" (upload your photo), virtual makeup try-on (1,400+ products), and virtual hair color.
- **Strengths:** 270,000+ women's items available for try-on, massive existing user base, integrated into full shopping experience, reducing returns
- **Weaknesses:** Locked to Walmart inventory only, no social features, utilitarian shopping context (not aspirational)
- **Threat level:** Low — validates consumer demand for try-on but Walmart's audience and positioning are fundamentally different from Polyvibe's.

### Sephora Virtual Artist (via ModiFace / L'Oréal)

- **What they do:** AR-based beauty try-on in Sephora app. Live 3D camera overlay for lip colors, eyeshadow, lashes. Powered by ModiFace (acquired by L'Oréal in 2018 for reported $100M+).
- **Traction:** 200M+ shades tried on within first 2 years. 80% online conversion lift reported.
- **Strengths:** Proven at scale, deep integration with Sephora's product catalog, real-time AR (not static image generation)
- **Weaknesses:** Beauty-only (no fashion apparel), locked to Sephora ecosystem, no social sharing or community
- **Relevance to Polyvibe:** Validates the "try before you buy" thesis in beauty. Relevant when Polyvibe expands into beauty/makeup category (see [ROADMAP.md — Phase 4](./ROADMAP.md#phase-4--category-expansion)).

### Zalando Virtual Fitting Room

- **What they do:** Piloting virtual fitting room for millions of customers across European markets.
- **Strengths:** Large European fashion e-commerce platform, deep brand relationships
- **Weaknesses:** Locked to Zalando inventory, no social features, limited to European market
- **Relevance to Polyvibe:** Validates demand among fashion-forward European consumers. Not a direct competitive threat in the US market.

### Prada

- **What they do:** Built proprietary virtual try-on for their own products.
- **Relevance to Polyvibe:** Signals luxury brand interest in try-on technology. Potential future brand partner if Polyvibe offers white-label or integration capabilities (see [BUSINESS.md — Future Revenue](./BUSINESS.md#3-future-revenue-opportunities-not-yet-prioritized)).

---

## Affiliate / Creator Commerce Platforms

These platforms monetize fashion discovery through affiliate links and creator content. They overlap with Polyvibe's commerce model but lack AI try-on.

### ShopLTK (LIKEtoKNOW.it)

- **What they do:** The original creator affiliate platform. Creators post shoppable content, followers buy through affiliate links. LTK takes a commission.
- **Founded:** 2011
- **Scale:** 200K+ creators, 6,000+ retail partners, 20M monthly app users, $3B+ in annual retail sales driven, operating in 100+ countries
- **Strengths:** Massive scale, established brand relationships, proven monetization model, dedicated consumer shopping app
- **Weaknesses:** No AI try-on, no avatar technology, content is static photos/videos, discovery is creator-driven (not personalized to your body), increasingly seen as dated by younger creators
- **Relevance to Polyvibe:** Validates the affiliate commerce model at scale. Polyvibe's AI try-on could be the next evolution of what LTK started — instead of seeing a creator in an outfit, see *yourself* in it. Potential integration partner for affiliate infrastructure. See [BUSINESS.md — Revenue Streams](./BUSINESS.md#1-affiliate-commerce-primary) for Polyvibe's affiliate strategy.

### ShopMy

- **What they do:** Creator affiliate platform with storefronts, brand partnerships, and a new consumer shopping platform (launched July 2025). Features include "Circles" (curated shops from trusted creators), personalized "Taste Profile," and wishlisting.
- **Funding:** $77.5M Series B (January 2025), led by Bessemer Venture Partners and Bain Capital Ventures
- **Scale:** 175K+ creators, 47K+ brands, 1,500+ direct brand partners, revenue up 650% in 2024
- **Strengths:** Rapid growth, modern UI, higher creator commission rates (10–30%), geolinking for international audiences, weekly payouts, strong brand partnerships
- **Weaknesses:** No AI try-on or avatar technology, discovery is creator-curated (not personalized to you), new consumer platform is unproven
- **Relevance to Polyvibe:** Growing fast in the same affiliate fashion space. Their "Circles" and "Taste Profile" features are interesting discovery mechanics. Polyvibe differentiates with AI visualization — ShopMy shows you what a creator recommends, Polyvibe shows you what *you* look like in it.

---

## Social Discovery Platforms

Platforms where users already discover fashion, but without AI try-on.

### Pinterest

- **What they do:** Visual discovery and inspiration platform. Users save pins, create boards, and discover products. Strong shopping integration with affiliate links.
- **Strengths:** Massive user base with high purchase intent, visual-first UX, established shopping partnerships, acquired THE YES (Julie Bornstein's fashion recommendation app) in 2022
- **Weaknesses:** No AI try-on, no personalization to your body, static images only, broad platform (not fashion-specific)
- **Relevance to Polyvibe:** Polyvibe is explicitly positioned as "the Pinterest for generative AI" (see [PRODUCT.md — Vision](./PRODUCT.md#vision)). Pinterest validates that visual discovery drives commerce intent. Polyvibe adds the personalization layer Pinterest lacks.

### Instagram / TikTok

- **What they do:** Social platforms where fashion content thrives organically. TikTok Shop has added native commerce. Instagram has Shopping features.
- **Strengths:** Massive reach, strong fashion creator communities, video-first content, native commerce features
- **Weaknesses:** Not purpose-built for fashion, no try-on, algorithm serves all content types (not style-focused), commerce features are add-ons not core experience
- **Relevance to Polyvibe:** Primary distribution channels for Polyvibe's UGC marketing strategy (see [MARKETING.md — Core Channels](./MARKETING.md#core-channels)). Polyvibe doesn't compete with these platforms — it uses them for acquisition and complements them with a focused try-on + discovery experience.

## Inspirational / Adjacent

Products that inform Polyvibe's thinking without being direct competitors.

| Product | What It Does | What's Interesting for Polyvibe |
|---|---|---|
| **Higgsfield AI** | AI video and avatar generation platform. Talking avatars, character swaps, multi-model video creation. | Avatar generation quality benchmark. Their "AI Stylist" feature signals market direction. Could inform Polyvibe's video-based try-on output. |
| **GoWish** | Social wishlisting platform | Social wishlisting mechanics could inform Polyvibe's save/wishlist features |
| **Freepik Pikaso** | AI image generation tool | Generation quality benchmark for AI-rendered imagery |
| **Zemith** | AI stylist / fashion focus app | Styling and focus-based UX approach |

## Polyvibe Differentiators

No competitor combines all three of Polyvibe's core pillars:

| Capability | Polyvibe | Doji | Gensmo | Alta | Daydream | LTK | ShopMy | Google | Walmart |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AI avatar try-on | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | Yes* | Yes* |
| Social feed / community | Yes | No | No | No | No | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Affiliate commerce | Yes | Planned | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Own inventory |
| Private workspace | Yes | N/A | No | No | No | No | No | No | No |
| Style persona / profiles | Yes | No | No | No | No | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Cross-brand discovery | Yes | Planned | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |

*Google and Walmart offer try-on against your photo, not a persistent avatar.

### Polyvibe's moat is the combination of:
1. **Private AI workspace** — experiment with confidence before going public (see [PRODUCT.md — Product Philosophy](./PRODUCT.md#product-philosophy))
2. **Public social discovery** — community-driven style inspiration and virality
3. **Affiliate commerce** — monetize the "I saw myself in it" moment (see [BUSINESS.md — Revenue Streams](./BUSINESS.md#revenue-streams))
4. **Avatar-first personalization** — every experience starts with *you*, not a model

The closest competitor is **Doji** (avatar + try-on), but they lack social discovery and commerce. The most well-funded is **Gensmo** ($60M), but their agent-first UX is fundamentally different from Polyvibe's visual, social-first approach.

---

## Market Signals

The competitive landscape validates Polyvibe's thesis:

- **Capital is flowing in:** Gensmo ($60M), Daydream ($50M), ShopMy ($77.5M Series B), Doji ($14M), Alta ($11M) — hundreds of millions raised in AI fashion in 2024–2025 alone
- **Retailers are building it themselves:** Google, Walmart, Zalando, Sephora, Prada — try-on is becoming table stakes for major retailers
- **"Vibe" is the language:** Gensmo's "Vibe Imagine" feature mirrors Polyvibe's core positioning — the market is converging on this language
- **Social + commerce is the unlock:** ShopMy and LTK prove that creator-driven affiliate commerce works. Polyvibe adds the missing AI personalization layer.
- **Speed to market matters:** The window for establishing a consumer-facing AI try-on + social platform is open but closing as competitors scale

---

## Key Takeaways for Strategy

1. **Doji is the primary watch target.** Closest to Polyvibe's vision. Monitor their product roadmap, social feature launches, and user growth.
2. **Gensmo's funding is a market signal, not a death sentence.** Their agent-first approach is a different bet. Polyvibe's visual-first, social-first UX is a deliberate differentiation.
3. **The "private before public" flow is unique.** No competitor has this. It's Polyvibe's strongest UX differentiator and should be protected and emphasized.
4. **Affiliate commerce model is validated.** Daydream, LTK, ShopMy all prove commission-based fashion commerce works at scale.
5. **Avatar creation speed is a competitive battleground.** Doji takes 30 minutes. Google needs just a selfie. Polyvibe's onboarding speed directly impacts the FTUE magic moment (see [PRODUCT.md — FTUE](./PRODUCT.md#first-time-user-experience-ftue)).
6. **B2B try-on APIs (FASHN, Kling) could accelerate Polyvibe's tech.** Evaluate build-vs-buy for the generation pipeline (see [ROADMAP.md — Open Questions](./ROADMAP.md#decisions-pending--open-questions)).
