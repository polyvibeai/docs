# Polyvibe

**"What's your vibe?"**

Polyvibe is an AI-powered virtual try-on fashion app that combines AI avatar technology with social discovery mechanics. We're building the Pinterest for generative AI — starting with fashion, expanding into all creative categories.

## What We're Building

Polyvibe lets users create a personalized AI avatar, virtually try on outfits in a private workspace, and optionally share their looks publicly for community discovery and commerce. The app bridges the gap between the virtual AI world and the real world of fashion and personal style.

**The core loop:**
1. User creates an AI avatar from their photos
2. User discovers and tries on outfits privately (Library → Try-On → Generations)
3. User optionally shares looks publicly (Posts → Feed → Profile)
4. Community discovers, saves, and shops through affiliate links

## Core Principles

- **AI is the hook** — The virtual try-on experience is what earns attention and drives downloads
- **Private before public** — Users experiment and gain confidence privately before sharing publicly
- **Research over assumptions** — Validate user behavior and persona fit through testing, not guesswork
- **Confidence before commerce** — Users must feel good in a look before they'll buy it
- **Transformational, not transactional** — Messaging emphasizes what Polyvibe enables, not what it sells
