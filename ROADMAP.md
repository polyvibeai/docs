# Roadmap — Polyvibe

## Overview

Polyvibe's development is organized into three primary phases, moving from MVP validation through social engagement to monetization. The guiding philosophy is: **earn the right to the next phase** by validating the current one.

---

## Phase 1 — MVP Validation (Current)

**Goal:** Prove that the AI try-on experience creates delight, retention, and organic sharing.

**Definition of Success:**
- Users create an avatar and complete at least one try-on in their first session
- D7 retention above baseline for similar consumer apps
- Organic sharing observed (users posting generations without prompting)
- UGC content generates meaningful app installs

## Phase 2 — Social Engagement Activation

**Goal:** Activate the social layer of the product and prove the public feed creates discovery and virality.

**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 metrics validated. Users are creating avatars, generating looks, and showing retention signals.

**Definition of Success:**
- Community feed has meaningful daily content volume
- Feed-to-follow conversion rate shows users discovering and following others
- Post-to-affiliate-click rate demonstrates commerce intent from social content
- Organic growth observable (new users finding app through community posts)

### Key Features Shipping This Phase
- Public feed (algorithmic + chronological)
- Public profiles with shareable style grids
- Follow / follower mechanics
- Post-to-shop affiliate integration in feed
- Community content moderation pipeline
- Save / wishlist for community-discovered looks
- In-app sharing (share a generation directly to TikTok/Instagram from app)

### Key Milestones
- Feed design and engineering complete
- Affiliate link integration live and attributed
- Content moderation tooling operational
- Referral / invite mechanics built (sharing generates invite to friend)
- User interviews conducted to validate social feature engagement

## Phase 3 — PRO Subscription Launch

**Goal:** Introduce monetization via PRO tier and validate willingness to pay.

**Prerequisites:** Phase 2 validated. Active social engagement and meaningful returning user base established.

**Definition of Success:**
- 5%+ of active users convert to PRO within 60 days of launch
- PRO churn < 5% per month
- MRR growing month-over-month

### PRO Tier Features
- Unlimited monthly generations (free tier capped)
- Priority generation queue (faster results)
- Advanced customization (multi-item outfits, fine-tuned avatar controls)
- Early access to new categories (interior design, beauty)
- Exclusive PRO badge on public profile (status signal for social users)

### Key Milestones
- PRO paywall design and engineering complete
- App Store in-app purchase integration
- Free tier generation limits implemented
- PRO upgrade prompts placed contextually (not aggressively)
- Pricing validated through user interviews and A/B testing

---

## Phase 4 — Category Expansion

**Goal:** Extend the Polyvibe platform beyond fashion to validate the "Pinterest for generative AI" thesis.

**First Expansion Category (Candidate):** Interior Design — "What would this room look like with a different couch?"

### Expansion Considerations
- New category = new avatar type (room, space, person for beauty)
- Affiliate relationships must be established for each new category
- Brand messaging expands but must remain coherent
- New user personas may emerge per category
- Each expansion is its own mini-MVP with its own validation phase

---

## Long-Term Vision (18–36 months)

- Polyvibe is the go-to AI visualization platform for any creative decision
- Multi-category platform: fashion, interior, beauty, fitness, travel
- Creator economy layer: top users earn via affiliate revenue sharing
- Brand partnership program: direct brand integrations and sponsored placements
- Enterprise / white-label: try-on technology licensed to fashion retailers
- Potential venture raise or strategic acquisition by platform/retail player
